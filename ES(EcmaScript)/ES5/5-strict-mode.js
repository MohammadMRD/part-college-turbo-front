/**
 * Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:
 *
 *  *** Strict mode !== Sloppy mode ***
 *
 *  1- Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
 *  2- Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations:
 *     strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
 *  3- Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
